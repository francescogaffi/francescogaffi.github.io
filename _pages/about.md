I'm a second year PhD student in Statistics at Università Bocconi in Milano. My supervisors are [Antonio Lijoi](http://didattica.unibocconi.eu/mypage/index.php?IdUte=189615&idr=&lingua=eng) and [Igor Prünster](http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/index.php?IdUte=187032&cognome=PRUENSTER&nome=IGOR&urlBackMy=). My research interests are Bayesian Nonparametrics and Random Fields Theory. I'm currently working on linear functionals of random probability measures. 

Previously, I've obtained a Bachelor and a Master in Mathematics, focused on Probability Theory and Functional Analysis, both at Università di Roma Tor Vergata. My master thesis was about Functional Data Analysis on L<sup>2</sup>(S<sup>2</sup>), supervised by [Domenico Marinucci](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~marinucc/).
