I'm a second year PhD student in Statistics at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. My supervisor is Professor [Antonio Lijoi](http://didattica.unibocconi.eu/mypage/index.php?IdUte=189615&idr=&lingua=eng). My current research interests lie in Medical Statistics and Survival Analysis, with a particular focus on Public Health Data Analysis and Cancer Research. I'm currently working on statistical models for the natural history of breast cancer, using mammography screening data.

Previously, I've obtained a Bachelor in Mathematics and then a Master in Statistics, both at Padua University in Italy, and
I've spent a semester as an Erasmus student at KU Leuven, Belgium, where I’ve worked on my Master’s Thesis "Kernel estimation of quantile regression curves using copula modeling" under the supervision of Professor Irène Gijbels.
