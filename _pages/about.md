I'm a PhD student in Statistics at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. My supervisor is Professor [Marco Bonetti](http://didattica.unibocconi.eu/docenti/cv.php?rif=50573). I'm currently working on statistical models for the natural history of breast cancer, using mammography screening data.  My research interests lie in Medical Statistics and Survival Analysis, with a particular focus on Public Health Data Analysis and Cancer Research.

Previously, I've studied at Padua University in Italy.
I've completed a Bachelor in Mathematics and then a Master in Statistics, where I’ve deepened my knowledge of Theoretical Statistics, Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes and paired that with much more applied courses.
I've spent a semester as an Erasmus student at KU Leuven, Belgium, where I’ve worked on my Master’s Thesis.
