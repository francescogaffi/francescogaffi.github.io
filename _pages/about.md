Welcome to my personal web page!

I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in Statistics at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www-math.umd.edu/), [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/), mentored by [Lizhen Lin](https://www3.nd.edu/~llin4/). Previously, I was a Robert and Sara Lumpkins Postdoctoral Fellow in Statistics at the [Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics](https://acms.nd.edu/), [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), with the same mentor. I'm an external affiliate of the [Bayesian Learning Laboratory](https://bayeslab.unibocconi.eu/), a research unit of the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics ([BIDSA](https://bidsa.unibocconi.eu/)).

My research interests include topics in Bayesian nonparametrics and network data analysis. I am currently working on random partitions and permutations for dynamic and multilayer networks, in the context of node clustering, edge prediction and graph matching. I am interested in studying generalized notions of exchangebility that suitably match the structure of specific complex networks. I am also working on posterior consistency for stochastic block models. 

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+statistics), advised by [Antonio Lijoi](http://didattica.unibocconi.eu/mypage/index.php?IdUte=189615&idr=&lingua=eng) and [Igor Prünster](http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/index.php?IdUte=187032&cognome=PRUENSTER&nome=IGOR&urlBackMy=).

Previously, I've obtained a bachelor and a master in Mathematics, focused on probability theory and functional analysis, both at [Università di Roma Tor Vergata](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/index.php). My master thesis was about functional data analysis in the space of square-integrable functions on the sphere, supervised by [Domenico Marinucci](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~marinucc/).

I had music education at [Conservatorio Licinio Refice](http://www.conservatorio-frosinone.it/) in Frosinone. I play clarinet and bass clarinet.
