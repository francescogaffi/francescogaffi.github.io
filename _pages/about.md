Welcome to my personal web page!

I'm a Robert and Sara Lumpkins Posdoctoral Fellow in Statistics at the [Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics](https://acms.nd.edu/), [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), where I'm working with [Lizhen Lin](https://www3.nd.edu/~llin4/).
I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+statistics), advised by [Antonio Lijoi](http://didattica.unibocconi.eu/mypage/index.php?IdUte=189615&idr=&lingua=eng) and [Igor Prünster](http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/index.php?IdUte=187032&cognome=PRUENSTER&nome=IGOR&urlBackMy=). My research interests are in Bayesian nonparametrics. I'm currently working on linear functionals of random probability measures and hierarchical partitions for network data. 

Previously, I've obtained a bachelor and a master in Mathematics, focused on probability theory and functional analysis, both at [Università di Roma Tor Vergata](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/index.php). My master thesis was about functional data analysis on L<sup>2</sup>(S<sup>2</sup>), supervised by [Domenico Marinucci](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~marinucc/).

I had music education at [Conservatorio Licinio Refice](http://www.conservatorio-frosinone.it/) in Frosinone. I play clarinet and bass clarinet.
